  - Provides equations for calculating:<br>
    (**I**) Amperage _[current]_<br>
    (**E**) Voltage _[pressure]_<br>
    (**R**) Impedance _[resistance]_<br>
    (**P**) Wattage _[power]_<br>
  - A stock alternator's current output will be ~125A - ~150A, most of which is utilized to run the vehicle
    - For every 1000W of power, 69.44A of spare current at 14.4v, or 72.46A at 13.8v, is required <br>
      `P / E = I`  **or**  `E * I = P`
